* **Leave Queue** : Removes a user from the queue.
* **View Queue** : Displays the current list of participants with their names and positions.
* **Next in Line** : Removes the first user from the queue (e.g., after being served).
* **Interactive Interface** : Provides user-friendly buttons for seamless interaction.
